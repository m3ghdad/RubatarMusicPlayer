└── Has many: playlists OR albums

featured_playlists (Your playlist cards)
├── apple_playlist_id (e.g., "pl.u-vEe5t44Rjbm")
├── cover_image_url (Main image)
├── instrument_image_url (Footer icon)
├── footer_text (e.g., "Se Tār | سه تار")

2. Copy image URLs
3. Add new row to `featured_playlists` table
4. Set display_order (e.g., 4, 5, 6...)
5. **Done!** App shows new playlist immediately

### Hiding Content:
1. Go to table editor
2. Set `is_visible = false`
3. **Done!** Content disappears from app

### Reordering:
1. Update `display_order` numbers
2. **Done!** Content reorders in app
